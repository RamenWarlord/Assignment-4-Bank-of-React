Hosted on github pages: https://ramenwarlord.github.io/Assignment-4-Bank-of-React/
This is assignment 4 bank of react for my practical web development class.


### Below I'm going to write stuff for myself, feel free to ignore it

### Improvements/To Do: 
-better css
-fix date (format is wrong, first created item doesn't have date)
-seperate creation form from debits/credits into its own component
-potentionally convert it to fullstack and host it on a server instead

### Memorable Issues I ran into:
Hosting on GHpages: Followed guidelines, it wouldnt work. After struggling for a good hour+, I saw in f12 that console was logging api call info from axios which i have in my code. From this, I knew that react was working as intended and the page was deployed properly but the webpage wasnt showing the contents properly and showed a blank page. I googled in this specific direction and managed to find this: https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages/issues/3 where they picked up on someone else who had the same error. They were using router and because router works off root for localhost it works properly when testing but when hosted it doesnt. This is because github isnt root and so I had to specify a basename for the router and viola it worked.





# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
